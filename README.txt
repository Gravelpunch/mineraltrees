=====================Mineral Trees mod for Minetest 0.4.12!=========================
Mineral Trees is a mod designed to make all ores in default Minetest renewable, by making them literally grow on trees!
Around the world you will find rare clusters of mineral trees, trees that grow by absorbing one of the six minerals in Minetest into their trunks,
strengthening them and allowing them to grow to huge proportions. These minerals, found mostly in the bark, can be smelted out of the
tree leaving blooms, 9 of which can be crafted together to make the lump or crystal of the specific mineral. This applies to all trees
except the coal tree, the bark of which can instead be used as an effective fuel.

This mod depends on both the Default mod included with Minetest, and the plants_lib library by VanessaE. Both these mods must be installed in
order for this mod to not crash on startup.

I hope this mod helps!
